- 测试

Most compilers break down into three primary stages: Parsing, Transformation, and Code Generation:   
- *Parsing* is taking raw code and turning it into a more abstract representation of the code.
- *Transformation* takes this abstract representation and manipulates to do whatever the compiler wants it to.
- *Code Generation* takes the transformed representation of the code andturns it into new code.
